    <section id="FAQ">

        <h3>Church FAQ’s</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Many questions get asked by visitors to church, newcomers to town, and friends and neighbors of our members. Here’s a list of questions that may help you get to know Crestwood Christian Church better.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Who are the Disciples of Christ?</h3>
        <div>
            
            <p>We are a mainline Protestant denomination (similar to Methodists and Presbyterians) with more than 700,000 members in the United States and Canada. We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. We believe the Bible is God’s word, and we give each person the freedom to responsibly interpret the Bible for themselves. We celebrate communion weekly, and each church is autonomously governed (no one “higher up” tells us what to do – except God!). For more information on the denomination, you can visit disciples.org.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How big is the church?</h3>
        <div>
            
            <p>Our church, founded in 1960, has grown into a healthy and vibrant congregation. We currently have more than 600 active members and regular attendees. Our 8:30 a.m. service averages around 60 people; our 10:45 a.m. service usually has about 250 in attendance.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What time is your Sunday worship service?</h3>
        <div>
            
            <p>We have two worship services each Sunday, both held in the sanctuary.  Our 8:30 a.m. service is relaxed, featuring familiar hymns and piano accompaniment.  Our 10:45 a.m. service includes a choir and a children’s time.  Both services offer the celebration of communion every Sunday, and all believers are welcome to participate.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What do you offer for children on Sunday morning?</h3>
        <div>
            
            <p>Children are a special part of our congregation and we value them as full participants in the life of our church. Sunday School classes for children (preschool through the 12th grade) begin at 9:30 a.m. Following the Children’s Time in the 10:45 worship service, children ages 3 years old through second grade are dismissed to participate in their own time of singing, prayer and Bible learning known as Worship and Wonder (see below for more information on this program).</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What is Worship and Wonder? What will my child do there?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Worship and Wonder is a Montessori-influenced program which tells Bible stories using multi-sensory tools and offers children the opportunity to form responses to the stories out of their own life experiences.  Children learn the meaning of church traditions and learn to prepare for participation in the church’s worship practices. They learn to prepare themselves and quiet their minds in order to enter into worship and relationship with God, they learn how to talk with God and they learn stories from the Bible in a way that they can understand.  Children receive a small snack (usually vanilla wafers and a small piece of cheese) and also are given time to play with the story elements, do art work, build with blocks or other activities.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Who goes to your church?</h3>
        <div>
            
            <p>We have quite a mixture of people at Crestwood. Our congregation truly spans the ages, from newborns to folks in their 80s. You’ll find just about every type of person here – married, single, divorced, widowed – professionals, workers, retired – life-long Lexington residents and those who have just recently moved to the Bluegrass. But even more important than the kind of people who go here is the kind of people who are welcome here – everyone!</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Do I have to belong to your denomination to attend?</h3>
        <div>
            
            <p>Not at all! In fact, many in our congregation come from a church background other than the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). We have many former Catholics, Lutherans, Presbyterians and Methodists. We are a “patchwork” church – people with different church backgrounds “woven together” by God’s grace.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Do you have to dress up to attend your worship service?</h3>
        <div>
            
            <p>No!  Dressing up is not a requirement to worship with us at Crestwood. Some do wear their “Sunday best” but you’re also likely to see someone in slacks and a casual shirt, or even jeans. We believe the most important part about Sunday morning is showing up, ready to worship God.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What kind of things do you do in your worship service?</h3>
        <div>
            
            <p>We strive to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere at Crestwood. We greet each other so everyone feels welcomed; we share announcements and church news; we sing and listen to our choir perform beautiful music; we share the congregation’s joys and concerns and lift them to God in prayer; we read the Bible and talk about it through the sermon; we collect an offering to further God’s work; and we take communion weekly.</p>
        </div>


        <h3>Can a visitor take communion?</h3>
        <div>
            
            <p>Yes! We take communion each week as a tangible reminder of God’s gift to us in Jesus Christ. We believe in open communion – that means that anyone who believes in Jesus Christ is welcome to take communion, whether they are a church member or not.</p>
        </div>


        <h3>Who are your ministers?</h3>

        <h3>What kind of outreach is the church involved in?</h3>
        <div>
            
            <p>Crestwood is active in a variety of outreach ministries, both here in Lexington and around the world. One of the major local outreach activities of is our annual Habitat for Humanity build in which Crestwood partners with other Disciple Churches in the Lexington community to provide financial assistance and physical labor toward building a home for a family who otherwise wouldn’t have one. Our global outreach ministry is an active part of the church, helping us share our resources with a number of varied ministries around the world, from providing blankets to going on mission trips to helping respond to natural disasters.</p>

        <h3>With whom do I talk if I want to know more?</h3>
        <div>
            
            <p>We would love to answers any questions that you may have about Crestwood. If you didn’t find what you were looking for on our website, please email or call one of our ministers, see the <a href=""> Staff page </a> for their addresses.</p>
